# [Annotate.js](http://www.annotatejs.online/)

A tool for annotating Javascript code.

## Known issues:

 + While this tool can complement existing annotations, it is best to avoid adding code with annotations that contain example functions or any code examples at all.

 + Be careful with predefined functions. Sometimes the annotator fails to recognize nested functions in an argument. Better use predefined functions.
